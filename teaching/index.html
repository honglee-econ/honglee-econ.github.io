<p style="text-align:justify">&ldquo;Students in Professor Hong Lee&#39;s course appreciated the well-organized structure, accessibility, and enthusiasm he brought to teaching. The case studies were a highlight, described as interesting and insightful. Professor Lee&#39;s open and encouraging approach resonated positively with many students, contributing to a favorable learning environment. However, some challenges were noted, including issues with group dynamics in virtual breakout rooms and a desire for increased interaction. Additionally, a few students found the compressed schedule of seven case discussions in four weeks demanding. While the majority commended Professor Lee&#39;s teaching, some suggested more homework assignments for enhanced learning. Overall, the course received positive feedback, with potential improvements suggested for virtual engagement and workload distribution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>"Group work"</p>

<p>"Nothing, he is a great instructor and I would take his course again."</p>

<p>"I wish there was less lecture and more interaction."</p>

<p>"N/A"</p>

<p>"The frequency of class meetings."</p>

<p>"Doing it over Zoom."</p>

<p>"Feel like because the course was only 4 weeks long, they made it an hour and a half to fit everything in, but it could really be more of an hour."</p>

<p>"N/A"</p>

<p>"There is nothing that I dislike."</p>

<p>"I didn't like how fast-paced it was but I understand that it was 4 weeks so it's okay."</p>

<p>"Nothing"</p>

<p>"I least liked the groups and the amount of time in breakout rooms. My group would hardly ever respond and we were just there in silence as we each created our own assignment."</p>

<p>"N/A"</p>

<p>"NA"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I have no complaints."</p>

<p>"That we had 3 exams instead of just a midterm and final."</p>

<p>"Everyone kept their screen concealed, which made the whole class feel like the instructor is talking to a void."</p>

<p>"Homework can be worth more."</p>

<p>"Nothing"</p>

<p>"I personally do not see the point of this class at all. This is my second time taking it, and I still feel like I have learned nothing useful."</p>

<p>"Nothing"</p>

<p>"Nothing"</p>

<p>"There was nothing I didn't like."</p>

<p>"That the coursework is hard"</p>

<p>"The course has more material than needed. It could definitely be shortened."</p>

<p>"I did not like how there were asynchronous portions of notes and would rather have synchronous meetings on Wednesday since there is already reduced time to meet with instructors."</p>

<p>"I feel that the class time length was a little too long and could have achieved the same amount of material in 30 fewer minutes per class."</p>

<p>"Occasionally, classes were boring."</p>

<p>"I thought that there could have been more resources for exam review."</p>

<p>"N/A"</p>

<p>"Nothing to complain about."</p>
