<p style="text-align:justify">&ldquo;Students in Professor Hong Lee&#39;s course appreciated the well-organized structure, accessibility, and enthusiasm he brought to teaching. The case studies were a highlight, described as interesting and insightful. Professor Lee&#39;s open and encouraging approach resonated positively with many students, contributing to a favorable learning environment. However, some challenges were noted, including issues with group dynamics in virtual breakout rooms and a desire for increased interaction. Additionally, a few students found the compressed schedule of seven case discussions in four weeks demanding. While the majority commended Professor Lee&#39;s teaching, some suggested more homework assignments for enhanced learning. Overall, the course received positive feedback, with potential improvements suggested for virtual engagement and workload distribution.&rdquo;</p>
